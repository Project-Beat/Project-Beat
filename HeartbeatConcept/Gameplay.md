### Gameplay Loops

#### Primary 
you navigate your player on a grid and to the rhythm of the backgroundmusic, similar to [Crypt Of The Necrodancer](https://youtu.be/8zexaCJvg3A?t=3), just  in a [[platformer perspective]]. Different to Crypt Of The Necrodancer you don't have to move every beat, the main focus is to hit your abilities on the beat. You have fast and slower attacks, you can block and dodge. There are also (consumable) items. When you're not fighting enemies you explore your surrounding and interact with the environment. 

#### Secondary
You're slowly expanding your map and unlock different cities, forests and other locations that you can explore freely (with limitations). In those Places you can find Quests of different Types: 
- Main Quests or Sidequests
	- NPC quests
	- Storylevels
	- Arenafights
- Arena editor?
- Level editor?

Between the quests you ga back to your camp to save, heal, cook, ... you can customize and expand your camp (optional) 
You also unlock new Characters to play. They are freely playable in free arenafights and when youre not playing a main quest. But they might have their own will/limitations 

#### Tertiary
You progress the story through the mainquests but have the choice to do sidequests in between that dont affect the story.
