## Important for development

We use git lfs in this Repo.

If you are using the git commandline tool install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
and run `git lfs install`.

If you add a binary files you must tell git which about it `$ git lfs track "*.png"`

If you are using the Github Desktop Application you wound have to worry about that.
